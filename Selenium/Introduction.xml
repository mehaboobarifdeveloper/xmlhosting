		<description>&lt;p&gt;Why Automation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web-based applications are growing. These applications are very interactive and responsive and run on many platforms. So automation becomes essential for faster releases which is a need for agile process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages of Automation:&lt;br /&gt;1. Fast: Runs tests significantly faster than human users.&lt;br /&gt;2. Repeatable: Testers can test how the website or software reacts after repeated execution of the same operation.&lt;br /&gt;3. Run many times: Frequent regression testing&lt;br /&gt;4. Faster results: Rapid feedback to developers&lt;br /&gt;5. Run unlimited times: Virtually unlimited iterations of test case execution&lt;br /&gt;6. Works in all processes: Support for Agile and extreme development methodologies&lt;br /&gt;7. Documentation: Disciplined documentation of test cases&lt;br /&gt;8. Auto Defect Report: Customized defect reporting&lt;br /&gt;9. Comprehensive Coverage: Testers can build test suites of tests that covers every feature in software application. This helps in finding defects missed by manual testing&lt;/p&gt;</description>
