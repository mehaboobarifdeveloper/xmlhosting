&lt;enclosure url="http://blog.parallelbranch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/selenium.jpg" length="12216320" type="image/png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web-based applications are growing. These applications are very interactive and responsive and run on many platforms. So automation becomes essential for faster releases which is a need for agile process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages of Automation:&lt;br /&gt;1. Fast: Runs tests significantly faster than human users.&lt;br /&gt;2. Repeatable: Testers can test how the website or software reacts after repeated execution of the same operation.&lt;br /&gt;3. Run many times: Frequent regression testing&lt;br /&gt;4. Faster results: Rapid feedback to developers&lt;br /&gt;5. Run unlimited times: Virtually unlimited iterations of test case execution&lt;br /&gt;6. Works in all processes: Support for Agile and extreme development methodologies&lt;br /&gt;7. Documentation: Disciplined documentation of test cases&lt;br /&gt;8. Auto Defect Report: Customized defect reporting&lt;br /&gt;9. Comprehensive Coverage: Testers can build test suites of tests that covers every feature in software application. This helps in finding defects missed by manual testing&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;1. It is a set of many software tools to perform test automation&lt;br /&gt;2. Entire suite of tools helps QA to automate web applications (note cannot automate native desktop apps)&lt;br /&gt;3. This tools help in locating user interface elements, performing action on it and then verifying the expected results with actual results&lt;br /&gt;4. Key feature of Selenium is QA can create test once and run it on multiple browsers&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;A Story of Marriage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who did it and what was done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. First Creator: Jason Huggins&lt;br /&gt;2. First developed as a javascript library to interact with the web page and run tests against multiple browser&lt;br /&gt;3. The Javascript library created became Selenium Core(now it contains all functionality of RC and IDE)&lt;br /&gt;4. The above library could control a browser from the language of our choice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why there was a need for more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Since the library for automation was Javascript based, the security limitations provided by the browser against javascript resulted in limiting the power of the &lt;br /&gt;library.&lt;br /&gt;2. Web Applications became more powerful with newer features that are native to browser. Using external javascript programs to automate/control browser became more &lt;br /&gt;difficult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who came for help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Simon Stewart from google came up with WebDriver project that could solve many of the problems&lt;br /&gt;2. WebDriver can speak directly to browser using native methods of browser(no sandbox)&lt;br /&gt;3. In 2008, Selenium and webdriver got married :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt;Selenium toolset consists of following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Selenium 2.0: Contains webdriver API + Selenium 1&lt;br /&gt;2. Selenium 1.0: It contains Selenium RC/Remote Control.Selenium 1 APIs(javascript bases) are deprecated and is not actively supported. It is in maintainance mode to support remote execution.&lt;br /&gt;3. Selenium IDE: Integrated Development Environment is a Firefox Plugin which is prototyping tool for building test scripts.It has an UI for developing automated tests where your can record user actions and play the actions.thods of browser(no sandbox)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<title>Choosing Selenium Tool</title>
		<pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2016 15:17:32 GMT</pubDate>
		<description>&lt;p&gt;1. Beginner: Start with IDE. Learn how it works and its selenium commands underneath. If its very simple tests, use it. Dont use it for Test Automation for a project&lt;br /&gt;2. Use Selenium 2: If you are automating a project then start using Selenium 2.0&lt;/p&gt;</description>
